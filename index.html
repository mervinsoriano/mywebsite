        <h2>My Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Hello my name is Mervin. I was born in the Philippines and moved to California when I was 14, moved to Spokane when I was 16 and have been living here since. I graduated from EWU with a double major in Computer Science and Visual Communication Design under the tutelage of Mindy Breen. I am currently the Associate Product Designer for a cloud-based video surveillance company based in Liberty Lake.

            The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head
            and hands, and then work outward from there.

            A few words used lazily might very well promise to ignite a fire no

          Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own
          business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling,
          worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact
          with different people all the time so that you can never get to know
          anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!
